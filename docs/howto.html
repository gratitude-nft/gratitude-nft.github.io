                Minting your first NFT is a pain for everyone that has 
                gone before you. Hopefully this article will help improve 
                your mint experience. It does get easier the more you do 
                it. Let's first start off by opening your MetaMask mobile 
                app.
              </p>

              <img width="50%" alt="main screen" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163683107-12348eb3-8e48-4635-b080-925a4a49a76c.png" />

              <p>
                Next press the menu icon, found on the top left on your 
                screen <em>(it looks like a hamburger)</em>. You want to 
                look for &quot;Browser&quot; and press it.
              </p>

              <img width="50%" alt="menu" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163683127-9262b7fa-1b06-4a4d-bada-aa8eb3fc05cd.png" />

              <p>
                Next press the address bar on the top and enter 
                <strong>gratitudegang.io</strong>. This should load the 
                main website.
              </p>
              
              <img width="50%" alt="browser" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163683146-86496859-d33d-4ff0-be4d-7858a4f05574.png" />

              <p>
                When the home page loads up, press &quot;Mint Now&quot; to 
                load the mint page.
              </p>
              <img width="50%" alt="home page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163683165-663d1617-3c68-4ae1-bfcb-30c8ab20950a.png" />

              <p>
                When the mint page loads up, press 
                &quot;Connect Your Ethereum Wallet&quot;. This will 
                connect your MetaMask wallet and a form should load.
              </p>
              <img width="50%" alt="mint page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163683178-295890b2-08d3-4dba-bc34-7862f3c6b102.png" />

              <p>
                Next enter the amount of NFTs you would like to mint. 
                Remember to mint a Gratitude Gang NFT you need to load 
                0.08 ETH per NFT you would like. You also may want to 
                add an extra 0.01 ETH to cover the gas cost in your 
                calculations. 
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                <strong>Note:</strong> The gas cost is what Ethereum 
                charges you to process a transaction on the blockchain. 
                This is not our cost.
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                <strong>Note:</strong> If you need more ethereum please 
                see <a class="nav" href="#ethereum">

              <p>
                Press &quot;Mint&quot; to see the final cost. A popup 
                will appear that will show a break down of all fees.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                <strong>Note:</strong> A good gas price is $30 or less. 
                If you are seeing anything more than that, &quot;Reject&quot; 
                the transaction and try again at a later time because the 
                gas price depends on how many people are transacting 
                with the blockchain at the same time.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                If MetaMask did not tell you any errors and when you are 
                happy with the gas cost, press &quot;Confirm&quot;. Next
                look for the green box on the webpage and simply wait for 
                10 confirmations.

              <h1>How to buy Ethereum with MetaMask?</h1>
              <p>
                It's been possible to buy ETH (on Ethereum mainnet) in 
                MetaMask for some time now. To maximise your options 
                and make your transition to Web3 interaction as seamless 
                as possible more payment gateways are being added 
                regularly.
              </p>
              <img width="50%" alt="wallet screen" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163681751-7dff73b4-1d09-4bc5-8053-c5c1d23183ae.png" />
              <p>On the app homepage, click the &quot;Buy&quot; button.</p>
              
              <img width="50%" alt="payment options" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163681901-c26461a1-7f3f-4bde-91db-9723f2a5c83f.png" />
              <p>
                You'll now see a screen where you can select which payment 
                gateway provider you'd like to use.
              </p>
              
              <img width="50%" alt="started" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163681937-0afb053a-0f3c-4bf0-8663-4f67e04d50d6.png" />
              <p>
                When you've selected a provider, you'll be redirected to 
                their platform, although you'll stay within the MetaMask 
                app. Enter the amount of fiat currency you'd like to spend 
                to generate an estimate of how much crypto you'll receive 
                and the fees you'll have to pay.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's at this stage that you can change the type of token 
                you're buying. Tap the currently selected token 
                (e.g. ETH is selected by default when on Ethereum mainnet) 
                to bring up a list of alternatives. The network you're 
                buying for will also be displayed alongside the token.
              </p>

              <h2>Payment Gateway Providers</h2>

              <p>
                Here is a list of payment gateway providers you can use on 
                MetaMask.

                There are many crypto wallets to choose from, but 
                <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> 
                is the most popular. With direct integration on 
                <a href="https://opensea.io/" target="_blank">OpenSea</a> 
                — the largest Ethereum NFT marketplace and a gallery to 
                view your digital collectibles, MetaMask is also the

              </p>

              <p>
                Metamask is a kind of digital wallet, but it is far 
                different from your ordinary digital wallet, Metamask uses 
                and takes advantage of the new blockchain technology, to 
                store, and secure all the information and transactions 
                of its users.
              </p>

              <p>
                Metamask is not only a wallet but also a key, it will 
                serve as a key at some of your transactions online, instead 
                of creating and memorizing some different passwords and 
                accounts and using it on every transaction, Metamask will 
                serve as a universal key that enables you to complete the 
                transaction with just a click of a button, all you need to 
                do is to set up a Metamask Wallet, create your password, 
                memorize your 12 secret phrases (recovery phrase) and it's 
                all done, once the setup is complete, you can do all 
                transaction using your Metamask Wallet with a power of a 
                click.

              <p>
                The first step in getting set up with MetaMask is creating 
                a wallet. Click on the &quot;Create a Wallet&quot; button. 
                You will then need to create a password with a minimum of 
                eight characters that you will use to log in to the 
                mobile app in the future.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Secret Backup Phrase</h3>

              <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120378/163681602-3c676239-2610-4b3b-ac11-9eb01e1336b0.png" />

              <p>
                Your Secret Backup Phrase is a way to easily backup and 
                restore your account at any time. It consists of twelve 
                words in a particular sequence. It is essential to 
                memorize this, write it down on a piece of paper and place 
                it in a safe place.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                Without your Secret Backup Phrase, it will be impossible 
                to restore your account. You can download the phrase and 
                store it on an external encrypted hard drive or storage 
                device for added security. We do not recommend copy and 
                pasting it into a notepad and leaving it on your desktop.
                If your computer gets stolen, hacked, or someone finds 
                the file, someone can easily log in to your MetaMask wallet.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                Confirm your Secret Backup Phrase on the next on-screen 
                prompt when you have it safely stored. This step ensures 
                you have the correct phrase on hand in case you need to 
                restore your account. After confirming your Secret Backup 
                Phrase, click on the &quot;All Done&quot; button. You have 
                now created a MetaMask wallet and are connected to the 
                Ethereum Mainnet and congratulations you have now your first 
                Metamask Wallet!
